**Key Contributions:**
- Developed Python code to implement the Monte Carlo method, likelihood analysis, chi-square analysis, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.
- Developed code for a slope parameter $\beta$ to quantify the redshift evolution of local Dispersion Measure (DM) of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host galaxy. 


### OVERVIEW
This project combined computational analysis with an extensive literature review to replicate and analyze findings from a study by Yang Pei Yuan and Bing Zhang. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in generating data for the dispersion measure of host galaxies in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and to apply various statistical tools to constrain the ΛCDM model.
