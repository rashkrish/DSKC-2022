## Project Tile: Constraining ΛCDM Model and Dispersion Measure of Host Galaxies Using Statistical Tools on FRBs

I collaborated on a team project during a summer workshop, combining computational analysis with an extensive literature review. In this project, we replicated and analyzed the findings of a study by Yang Pei Yuan and Bing Zhang. The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in generating data for the dispersion measure of host galaxies in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) while also applying various statistical tools to constrain the ΛCDM Model.

- I acquired proficiency in techniques such as the Monte Carlo method, likelihood analysis, chi-square analysis, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. I implemented these algorithms within a Python environment and conducted rigorous testing of the model using both 50 and 500 data points, enhancing the reliability and comprehensiveness of the analysis.
