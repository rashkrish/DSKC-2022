**Key Contributions:**
- Developed Python code to implement the Monte Carlo method, likelihood analysis, chi-square analysis, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for statistical modelling and analysis.
- Developed Python code to calculate a slope parameter $\beta$ to quantify the redshift (z) evolution of local Dispersion Measure of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host galaxy denoted by $DM_{HG,loc}$.
- Evaluated and visualized the influence of different cosmological and host galaxy parameters on Dispersion Measure and its evolution with redshift.
- Demonstrated trends and deviations through rigorous computational modelling and visualization.
- Generated data for FRBs for dispersion measure of host galaxies that also constrains $\Lambda CDM$ model of host galaxies and tested the model for 500 data points for specific z=3.
- Developed Python code to demonstrate Monte Carlo simulations that the average value of the local host galaxy dispersion measure, along with other cosmological parameters (such as mass density in $\Lambda CDM$ model and the Intergalactic medium component of the baryon energy density) can be measured independently using minimum chi-square fitting to the data. 

### OVERVIEW
- This project combined computational analysis with an extensive literature review to replicate and analyze findings from a study by *Yang Pei Yuan and Bing Zhang (2016)*. 
- In this project, we first learned and applied statistical techniques such as the Monte Carlo method, likelihood analysis, chi-square fitting, and MCMC. We then aimed to reproduce results from the paper by Yang Pei Yuan and Bing Zhang (2016) by using Monte Carlo methods to generate simulated data for Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host galaxies. Additionally, we demonstrated that the average value of the local host galaxy dispersion measure, along with other cosmological parameters (such as mass density in the ΛCDM model and the intergalactic medium component of the baryon energy density), can be measured independently using minimum chi-square fitting to the generated data.
