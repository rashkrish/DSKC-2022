**Key Contributions:**
- Developed Python code to implement the Monte Carlo method, likelihood analysis, chi-square analysis, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.
- Developed Python code for a slope parameter $\beta$ to quantify the redshift (z) evolution of local Dispersion Measure of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host galaxy denoted by $DM_{HG,loc}$.
- Evaluated and visualized the influence of different cosmological and host galaxy parameters on Dispersion Measure and its evolution with redshift.
- Demonstrated trends and deviations through rigorous computational modelling and visualization.

### OVERVIEW
This project combined computational analysis with an extensive literature review to replicate and analyze findings from a study by *Yang Pei Yuan and Bing Zhang*. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in generating data for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) host galaxies and to apply various statistical tools to constrain the ΛCDM model.
